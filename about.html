    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Timber Stone Whisky is proudly based in Bragg Creek, nestled in the stunning Rocky Mountains of Alberta, Canada. Surrounded by towering peaks and pristine forests, our location inspires the craft of exceptional whisky.
      
      Founded in 2024 by Bryce Schaab and a passionate group of whisky enthusiasts, we set out to create a spirit that reflects the rugged beauty and strength of the Rockies. Every bottle that we make is created with locally sourced ingredients, distilled with care, and aged to perfection, creating a memorable drink every time you splash our drink into your glass.
      
      At Timber Stone Whisky, we are committed to crafting a whisky that celebrates both our heritage and the untamed spirit of the Rockies.</p>
